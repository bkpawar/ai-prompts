# Stock Screening - Sectors Near Breakout

Owner: Bhupendra Pawar

Act as an experienced technical and fundamental research analyst for the Indian stock market.

Your task is to conduct a historical analysis to identify stocks that were exhibiting characteristics of a potential bullish breakout *as of your last knowledge update (mid-2025)*. This analysis is for investing purposes to understand the confluence of factors that can precede significant price moves.

**Methodology:**

1. **Thematic/Sectoral Focus:** First, identify 2-3 promising themes or sectors that had strong tailwinds as of mid-2025 (e.g., EV ecosystem, PLI scheme beneficiaries, pre-festive season consumption).
2. **Define Screening Criteria:** For each theme, screen for stocks that met the following specific blend of fundamental and technical criteria at that time:
    - **Fundamental Strength:** Consistent year-over-year (YoY) revenue and EPS growth for the preceding 2-3 quarters.
    - **Technical 'Breakout' Setup:**
        - **Price Action:** Stock was trading in a consolidation pattern (e.g., a "high tight flag" or "ascending triangle") near its 52-week high.
        - **Moving Averages:** Price was trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, with the 50-day SMA above the 200-day SMA.
        - **Volume:** There was evidence of volume accumulation during the consolidation phase.
        - **Relative Strength:** The stock was showing strong relative strength compared to the Nifty 500 index.

**Output Format:**

For each identified theme, provide a detailed analysis of 1-2 stocks that fit the criteria. Structure each analysis as follows:

- **Company & Thematic Rationale:** Briefly explain the company and why it aligns with the chosen theme.
- **Fundamental Snapshot (as of mid-2025):** Key data points on its recent growth performance.
- **Technical Analysis (as of mid-2025):**
    - Describe the specific price and volume pattern the stock was exhibiting.
    - Mention key historical price levels: the **resistance level** (potential breakout point) and the nearest **support level**.
- **Risk Factors:** Outline the primary business or market risks associated with the company at that time.
