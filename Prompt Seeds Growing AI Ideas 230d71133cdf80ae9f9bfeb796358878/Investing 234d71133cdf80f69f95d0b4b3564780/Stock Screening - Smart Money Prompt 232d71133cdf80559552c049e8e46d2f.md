# Stock Screening - Smart Money  Prompt

Owner: Bhupendra Pawar

Act as an expert stock screening analyst. Your task is to identify Indian listed companies that have shown significant institutional buying interest based on the most recently declared quarterly shareholding patterns.

**Context and Methodology:**
Your analysis should be based on a comparison between the shareholding data of the quarter ending **June 30, 2025**, and the previous quarter ending **March 31, 2025**. Your response should be based on data available up to your last training cut-off.

**Screening Criteria:**
Apply the following filters to generate the list:

1. **Market Capitalization:** Must be greater than ₹10,000 crore (focus on mid-cap and large-cap companies).
2. **Institutional Buying Threshold:** Must meet at least ONE of the following conditions:
    - Increase in FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) holding by at least 1.5%.
    - Increase in DII (Domestic Institutional Investors) holding by at least 2%.
3. **Public Holding:** There should ideally be a corresponding decrease in Public shareholding.

**Output Format:**

1. **Summary:** Start with a brief paragraph summarizing the methodology and the general trend observed (e.g., whether institutional interest was broad-based or sector-specific).
2. **Data Table:** Present the top 10-15 companies that best fit these criteria in a Markdown table with the following columns:
    - `Company Name`
    - `NSE Symbol`
    - `Sector`
    - `Market Cap (₹ Cr)`
    - `Change in FII % (QoQ)`
    - `Change in DII % (QoQ)`
    - `Change in Public % (QoQ)`
    - `Rationale/Observation`
3. **Disclaimer:** Conclude with a clear disclaimer that this data is for informational purposes, based on historical patterns, is not real-time, and does not constitute financial advice. Advise that investors must verify the latest data and conduct their own due diligence.
