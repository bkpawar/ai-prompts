    ---
    
    **Prompt:**
    
    Act as a seasoned technical analyst with deep expertise in chart patterns, trend strength, volume dynamics, and Stan Weinstein’s Stage Analysis.
    
    Provide a comprehensive technical audit of the company specified above, following this structured checklist:
    
    **1. Primary Trend & Key Moving Averages:**
    
    - What is the status of the short-term trend (e.g., price relative to the 21-day and 50-day EMAs)?
    - What is the status of the long-term primary trend (price relative to the 200-day/40-week SMA)?
    
    **2. Trend Strength:**
    
    - Analyze the Average Directional Index (ADX). Is the ADX value above 25, suggesting a strong trend (either up or down)? Is the +DI above or below the -DI?
    
    **3. Volume Confirmation:**
    
    - Is the prevailing price trend confirmed by volume? (e.g., are up-moves accompanied by volume significantly above the 50-day average? Are pullbacks occurring on lighter volume?).
    
    **4. Chart Patterns:**
    
    - Identify any significant bullish or bearish chart patterns that have formed or are in development on the daily or weekly chart. Look for patterns like:
        - **Base/Consolidation Patterns:** Cup-and-handle, flat base, rounding bottom, ascending/descending triangles.
        - **Continuation/Reversal Patterns:** Head-and-shoulders (or inverted), double top/bottom, flags/pennants.
    
    **5. Stage Analysis (Stan Weinstein Methodology):**
    
    - Based on the weekly chart, determine which of the four stages the stock is in:
        - **Stage 1:** Basing / Accumulation
        - **Stage 2:** Advancing / Uptrend
        - **Stage 3:** Topping / Distribution
        - **Stage 4:** Declining / Downtrend
    - Provide a clear rationale for your stage determination, referencing the price action relative to the 30-week moving average and the overall base structure.
    
    **6. Key Price Levels & Zones (Formerly Entry Triggers):**
    
    - Instead of specific entry points, identify the critical historical price zones:
        - **Key Resistance Zone:** What is the overhead supply area or prior peak that the stock needs to clear to move higher?
        - **Key Support Zone:** Where is the significant demand area or prior consolidation low that is likely to act as support?
        - **Pattern-Based Objective:** If a clear pattern (like a cup-and-handle) exists, what is the measured price objective based on the depth of the pattern?
    
    **7. Concluding Technical Synthesis (Formerly Summary):**
    
    - Instead of recommendations, provide a balanced synthesis of the findings:
        - **The Bull Case:** Summarize the technical factors (e.g., "In a Stage 2 uptrend, above all key MAs, breaking out on high volume...") that are positive for the stock.
        - **The Bear Case:** Summarize the cautionary technical factors (e.g., "Approaching major overhead resistance, showing negative divergence on RSI, volume drying up...").
