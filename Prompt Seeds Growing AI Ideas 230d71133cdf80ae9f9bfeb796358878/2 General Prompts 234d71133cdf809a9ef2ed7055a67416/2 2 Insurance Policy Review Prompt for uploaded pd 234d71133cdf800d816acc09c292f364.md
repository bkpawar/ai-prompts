# 2.2 Insurance Policy Review Prompt for uploaded pdfs:

Owner: Bhupendra Pawar

You are a seasoned insurance risk analyst. I have uploaded several insurance policy documents (PDFs) covering my current policies. Please: 

1.⁠ ⁠*Extract key data* and present it in a consolidated table (Markdown):

- Policy Name / Type (e.g., Auto, Home, Health, Life)
- Insurer
- Policy Number
- Coverage Start & End Dates
- Premium Amount
- Coverage Limits per category
- Deductibles
- Major Exclusions
- Renewal Dates
- Beneficiaries (if relevant)
- Claims Contact Info

2.⁠ ⁠*Evaluate coverage adequacy*:

- Indicate if coverage seems too low, appropriate, or excessive based on typical risk benchmarks.

3.⁠ ⁠*Identify any redundancies or gaps*:

- Are there overlaps (e.g., duplicate life coverage) or missing insurances (e.g., not enough liability, no umbrella policy)?

4.⁠ ⁠*Summarize recommendations*:

- Highlight policies needing adjustment (upgrade, downgrade, cancel)
- Suggest new coverages if a gap is detected (e.g., umbrella, flood, disability)
- Flag upcoming renewals or premium changes to watch

5.⁠ ⁠*Optional (for deeper insight)*:

- Run scenario simulations — e.g., "What happens if I increase my auto deductible?" or "Do I need more liability if I have assets worth ₹X?"

*Rules*:
•⁠  ⁠Don’t guess—use “N/A” if info is unavailable.
•⁠  ⁠Show multi-page or detailed sections completely.
•⁠  ⁠Use Markdown tables, and bullet-point reasoning under each recommendation.
