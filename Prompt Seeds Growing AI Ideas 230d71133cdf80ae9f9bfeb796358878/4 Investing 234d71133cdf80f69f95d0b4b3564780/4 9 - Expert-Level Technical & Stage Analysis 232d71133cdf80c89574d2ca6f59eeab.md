**Crucial Context:**
This analysis must be based on the stock's price and volume data available up to your knowledge cut-off of **July 2025**. It is a historical technical snapshot, not a real-time analysis.

**Prompt:**

Act as a seasoned technical analyst with deep expertise in chart patterns, trend strength, volume dynamics, and Stan Weinsteinâ€™s Stage Analysis.

Provide a comprehensive technical audit of the company specified above, following this structured checklist:

**1. Primary Trend & Key Moving Averages:**

- What is the status of the short-term trend (e.g., price relative to the 21-day and 50-day EMAs)?
- What is the status of the long-term primary trend (price relative to the 200-day/40-week SMA)?

**2. Trend Strength:**

- Analyze the Average Directional Index (ADX). Is the ADX value above 25, suggesting a strong trend (either up or down)? Is the +DI above or below the -DI?

**3. Volume Confirmation:**

- Is the prevailing price trend confirmed by volume? (e.g., are up-moves accompanied by volume significantly above the 50-day average? Are pullbacks occurring on lighter volume?).

**4. Chart Patterns:**

- Identify any significant bullish or bearish chart patterns that have formed or are in development on the daily or weekly chart. Look for patterns like:
    - **Base/Consolidation Patterns:** Cup-and-handle, flat base, rounding bottom, ascending/descending triangles.
    - **Continuation/Reversal Patterns:** Head-and-shoulders (or inverted), double top/bottom, flags/pennants.

**5. Stage Analysis (Stan Weinstein Methodology):**

- Based on the weekly chart, determine which of the four stages the stock is in:
    - **Stage 1:** Basing / Accumulation
    - **Stage 2:** Advancing / Uptrend
    - **Stage 3:** Topping / Distribution
    - **Stage 4:** Declining / Downtrend
- Provide a clear rationale for your stage determination, referencing the price action relative to the 30-week moving average and the overall base structure.

**6. Key Price Levels & Zones (Formerly Entry Triggers):**

- Instead of specific entry points, identify the critical historical price zones:
    - **Key Resistance Zone:** What is the overhead supply area or prior peak that the stock needs to clear to move higher?
    - **Key Support Zone:** Where is the significant demand area or prior consolidation low that is likely to act as support?
    - **Pattern-Based Objective:** If a clear pattern (like a cup-and-handle) exists, what is the measured price objective based on the depth of the pattern?

**7. Concluding Technical Synthesis (Formerly Summary):**

- Instead of recommendations, provide a balanced synthesis of the findings:
    - **The Bull Case:** Summarize the technical factors (e.g., "In a Stage 2 uptrend, above all key MAs, breaking out on high volume...") that are positive for the stock.
    - **The Bear Case:** Summarize the cautionary technical factors (e.g., "Approaching major overhead resistance, showing negative divergence on RSI, volume drying up...").
