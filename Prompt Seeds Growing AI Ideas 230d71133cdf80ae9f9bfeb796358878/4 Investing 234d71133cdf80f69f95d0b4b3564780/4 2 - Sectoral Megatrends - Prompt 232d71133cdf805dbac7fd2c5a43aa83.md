Act as an expert stock market analyst and investment strategist, preparing a report for a retail investor with a moderate risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon of 5-10 years.

Your task is to provide a detailed analysis of 3-5 key mega trends shaping the Indian economy and market landscape.

For each mega trend, structure your response as follows:

1. **Mega Trend Overview:**
    - **Trend Name:** (e.g., Digital Transformation, Green Energy Transition, etc.)
    - **Summary:** A concise paragraph explaining the trend and its long-term impact on the Indian economy.
    - **Key Drivers & Catalysts:** List 2-3 specific government policies, technological shifts, or consumer behavior changes driving this trend.
2. **Beneficiary Sectors:**
    - Identify the top 2-3 sectors poised for significant growth due to this trend.
3. **Company Analysis (Present in a Markdown Table):**
    - Provide a list of 3-4 well-established, Indian-listed companies set to benefit.
    - The table should have the following columns: `Company Name (Ticker)`, `Rationale for Inclusion`, and `Key Catalysts to Watch`.
4. **Potential Risks & Headwinds:**
    - Briefly describe potential risks, such as regulatory changes, competitive pressures, or execution challenges that could impact this trend or the associated companies.

Finally, conclude with a brief summary paragraph that synthesizes the findings and highlights the most compelling overarching opportunity for a long-term investor.

**Important Constraints:**

- Do not provide direct financial advice.
- The analysis must be objective and balanced, presenting both opportunities and risks.
- All information should be presented as if synthesized from credible public sources like industry reports, government publications, and company filings.
- Include a concluding disclaimer that this analysis is for informational purposes only and investors must conduct their own due diligence.
