    2.⁠ ⁠*Evaluate coverage adequacy*:
    
    - Indicate if coverage seems too low, appropriate, or excessive based on typical risk benchmarks.
    
    3.⁠ ⁠*Identify any redundancies or gaps*:
    
    - Are there overlaps (e.g., duplicate life coverage) or missing insurances (e.g., not enough liability, no umbrella policy)?
    
    4.⁠ ⁠*Summarize recommendations*:
    
    - Highlight policies needing adjustment (upgrade, downgrade, cancel)
    - Suggest new coverages if a gap is detected (e.g., umbrella, flood, disability)
    - Flag upcoming renewals or premium changes to watch
    
    5.⁠ ⁠*Optional (for deeper insight)*:
    
    - Run scenario simulations — e.g., "What happens if I increase my auto deductible?" or "Do I need more liability if I have assets worth ₹X?"
    
    *Rules*:
    •⁠  ⁠Don’t guess—use “N/A” if info is unavailable.
    •⁠  ⁠Show multi-page or detailed sections completely.
    •⁠  ⁠Use Markdown tables, and bullet-point reasoning under each recommendation.

- Stock Screening - Sectors Near Breakout
    
    Act as an experienced technical and fundamental research analyst for the Indian stock market.
    
    Your task is to conduct a historical analysis to identify stocks that were exhibiting characteristics of a potential bullish breakout *as of your last knowledge update (mid-2025)*. This analysis is for investing purposes to understand the confluence of factors that can precede significant price moves.
    
    **Methodology:**
    
    1. **Thematic/Sectoral Focus:** First, identify 2-3 promising themes or sectors that had strong tailwinds as of mid-2025 (e.g., EV ecosystem, PLI scheme beneficiaries, pre-festive season consumption).
    2. **Define Screening Criteria:** For each theme, screen for stocks that met the following specific blend of fundamental and technical criteria at that time:
        - **Fundamental Strength:** Consistent year-over-year (YoY) revenue and EPS growth for the preceding 2-3 quarters.
        - **Technical 'Breakout' Setup:**
            - **Price Action:** Stock was trading in a consolidation pattern (e.g., a "high tight flag" or "ascending triangle") near its 52-week high.
            - **Moving Averages:** Price was trading above its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, with the 50-day SMA above the 200-day SMA.
            - **Volume:** There was evidence of volume accumulation during the consolidation phase.
            - **Relative Strength:** The stock was showing strong relative strength compared to the Nifty 500 index.
    
    **Output Format:**
    
    For each identified theme, provide a detailed analysis of 1-2 stocks that fit the criteria. Structure each analysis as follows:
    
    - **Company & Thematic Rationale:** Briefly explain the company and why it aligns with the chosen theme.
    - **Fundamental Snapshot (as of mid-2025):** Key data points on its recent growth performance.
    - **Technical Analysis (as of mid-2025):**
        - Describe the specific price and volume pattern the stock was exhibiting.

    **Prompt:**
    
    Act as a seasoned technical analyst with deep expertise in chart patterns, trend strength, volume dynamics, and Stan Weinstein’s Stage Analysis.
    
    Provide a comprehensive technical audit of the company specified above, following this structured checklist:
    
    **1. Primary Trend & Key Moving Averages:**
    
    - What is the status of the short-term trend (e.g., price relative to the 21-day and 50-day EMAs)?
    - What is the status of the long-term primary trend (price relative to the 200-day/40-week SMA)?
    
    **2. Trend Strength:**
    
    - Analyze the Average Directional Index (ADX). Is the ADX value above 25, suggesting a strong trend (either up or down)? Is the +DI above or below the -DI?
    
    **3. Volume Confirmation:**
    
    - Is the prevailing price trend confirmed by volume? (e.g., are up-moves accompanied by volume significantly above the 50-day average? Are pullbacks occurring on lighter volume?).
    
    **4. Chart Patterns:**
    
    - Identify any significant bullish or bearish chart patterns that have formed or are in development on the daily or weekly chart. Look for patterns like:
        - **Base/Consolidation Patterns:** Cup-and-handle, flat base, rounding bottom, ascending/descending triangles.
        - **Continuation/Reversal Patterns:** Head-and-shoulders (or inverted), double top/bottom, flags/pennants.
    
    **5. Stage Analysis (Stan Weinstein Methodology):**
    
    - Based on the weekly chart, determine which of the four stages the stock is in:
        - **Stage 1:** Basing / Accumulation
        - **Stage 2:** Advancing / Uptrend
        - **Stage 3:** Topping / Distribution
        - **Stage 4:** Declining / Downtrend
    - Provide a clear rationale for your stage determination, referencing the price action relative to the 30-week moving average and the overall base structure.
    
    **6. Key Price Levels & Zones (Formerly Entry Triggers):**
    
    - Instead of specific entry points, identify the critical historical price zones:
        - **Key Resistance Zone:** What is the overhead supply area or prior peak that the stock needs to clear to move higher?
        - **Key Support Zone:** Where is the significant demand area or prior consolidation low that is likely to act as support?
        - **Pattern-Based Objective:** If a clear pattern (like a cup-and-handle) exists, what is the measured price objective based on the depth of the pattern?
    
    **7. Concluding Technical Synthesis (Formerly Summary):**
    
    - Instead of recommendations, provide a balanced synthesis of the findings:
        - **The Bull Case:** Summarize the technical factors (e.g., "In a Stage 2 uptrend, above all key MAs, breaking out on high volume...") that are positive for the stock.
        - **The Bear Case:** Summarize the cautionary technical factors (e.g., "Approaching major overhead resistance, showing negative divergence on RSI, volume drying up...").
